Q: Have the function FibonacciChecker(num) return the string yes if the number given is part of the Fibonacci sequence. This sequence is defined by: Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2, which means to find Fn you add the previous two numbers up. The first two numbers are 0 and 1, then comes 1, 2, 3, 5 etc. If num is not in the Fibonacci sequence, return the string no.

Code:-
function FibonacciChecker(num) {
  var prev = [0]
  for (i = 1; i < num+1; i) {
    var check = i + prev[0]
    if (check === num) {
      return 'yes'
    }
    prev.unshift(i)
    i = check
  }
  return 'no' 
}
console.log(FibonacciChecker(readline()));
