Q: Have the function SimpleMode(arr) take the array of numbers stored in arr and return the number that appears most frequently (the mode). For example: if arr contains [10, 4, 5, 2, 4] the output should be 4. If there is more than one mode return the one that appeared in the array first (ie. [5, 10, 10, 6, 5] should return 5 because it appeared first). If there is no mode return -1. The array will not be empty.

Code:-
function SimpleMode(arr) { 
const count = {};
  const firstOccurrence = {};
  let maxCount = 0;
  let mode = -1;
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    const num = arr[i];
    if (num in count) {
      count[num]++;
    } else {
      count[num] = 1;
      firstOccurrence[num] = i;
    }
    if (count[num] > maxCount || (count[num] === maxCount && firstOccurrence[num] < firstOccurrence[mode])) {
      maxCount = count[num];
      mode = num;
    }
  }
  return (maxCount > 1) ? mode : -1;
}
console.log(SimpleMode(readline()));
